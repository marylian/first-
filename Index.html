<p>The theme I chose is Car Purchase. I chose it because it was an exciting time in my life. Getting my first real job, and being able to buy a vehicle that I could actually consider to be a car! My budget however, was limited...although it still is. I was excited about owning my very own first car but there were challenges and decisions to be made on the way, such as: affordability, minimum gas mileage, and most importantly, safety and reliability.</p>
